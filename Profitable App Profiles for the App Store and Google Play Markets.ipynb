    "# 1. Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, an introductory statistical data analysis is made towards a better understanding of Android and iOS mobile apps on the Google Play and the App Store markets, respectively, aiming to identify tendencies and correlations between app's specifications/characteristics and their profitability. By doing that, the extracted knowledge may be useful to consolidate a strategic approach taken by a company for developing an app with certain specifications that lead to an higher expected profitability on the two considered markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Restraints to the App's Specifications for Development\n",
    "\n",
    "As restraints, this analysis only takes into account unpaid apps (free to download and install), thus the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. As a consequence, the profitability of an app is mostly influenced by the number of its users (directly proportional to add engagement). Additionally, it's imposed an idiom constraint, being directed to an English-speaking audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "These considerations set the rhetoric goal of the statistical data analysis: what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store, taking as constraints their price (must be free) and idiom (English). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the analysis purposes, it's necessary to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store, which satisfies the specified primary restraints. This composes the data methodology for validating an app idea, with its subsequent development and availability on the Google Play and the App Store, being comprised in the following way:\n",
    "- 1.1 Opening and Structuring the Data\n",
    "- 1.2 Data Cleaning\n",
    "- 1.3 Data Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "The final results are essentially suited for companies that align with the free apps market. Nevertheless, the adopted methodology (statistical data manipulation) can be adapted for paid apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:\n",
    "- Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.\n",
    "- If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.\n",
    "- If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.\n"

    "## 1.1 Opening and Structuring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For attending the set goals, it was decided to proceed with the analysis of two extensively studied datasets, that are available on the Kaggle website. For an indeepth insight about the both **datasets'** atributes/proprieties nominated by the **headers**, check [Google Play Store Apps dataset documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [Apple Store Apps dataset documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the two considered datasets and posteriorly saving to the same directory as this jupyter notebook, both were imported to the present notebook environment. As the both datasets are in the csv format, the usage of the csv package built in Python can be useful. On this package, exists two widely use subroutines/algorithms/methods that structure the input data (that is, organized its content): Reader and DictReader. For the purpose of a more intuitively data manipulation, as the headers are anticipally known, the subroutine DictReader was used, structuring each row of the csv file as an independent dictionary. In order to aggroup the data into one element, the rows on the csv file were condensed as dictionaries on a list, being formally referred as a list of dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulted data structure (list of dictionaries) allows the data search to be dependent of csv file's headers, as they are the keys of each entry (a dictionary) on the list. "

    "\n",
    "Intending to visualize the resulted data structure, as well as to perform some metrics (number of apps - rows on the csv file - and the number of headers - columns on the csv file - on both datasets), a function was designed, named explore_data(), allowing the abstraction of the conceived algorithm and minimization of repetitive code.   \n",
