    "# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, an **introductory data analysis** is made towards a better understanding of **Android** and **iOS mobile apps** on the **Google Play** and the **App Store markets**, respectively, aiming to identify **tendencies** and **correlations** between app's attributes and their **profitability**. By doing that, the extracted knowledge may be useful to consolidate a strategic approach, taken by a company, for **developing an app** with certain attributes, that lead to an higher expected profitability on the two considered markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Restraints to the App Attributes for Development \n",
    "\n",
    "As restraints, this analysis only takes into account **unpaid apps** (free to download and install), thus making the in-app ads the main source of revenue. As a consequence, the profitability of an app is mostly influenced by the number of its users (directly proportional to users' engagement). Additionally, it's imposed an idiom constraint, being directed to an **English-speaking audience**. \n",
    "\n",
    "These considerations set the **data analysis' rhetoric goal**: what type of apps are likely to attract more users on Google Play and the App Store, taking as constraints their price (must be free) and idiom (English)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the analysis purposes, it's necessary to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store, which satisfies the specified **primary restraints**. This composes the **data methodology** for validating an app idea, with its subsequent development and availability on the Google Play and the App Store, being comprised in the following way:\n",
    "- 1.**Opening and Structuring the Data**\n",
    "- 2.**Data Cleaning**\n",
    "- 3.**Data Analysis** \n",
    "\n",
    "The final results are essentially suited for companies that align with the free and English-speaking directed apps market. Nevertheless, the adopted methodology can be adapted for paid and non-English directed apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize risks and overhead, the **validation strategy** for an app idea is comprised of three steps:\n",
    "- Building a minimal Android version of the app, and adding it to Google Play;\n",
    "- If the app has a good response from users, it's further developed;\n",
    "- If the app is profitable after six months, an iOS version of the app is built and added to the App Store."

    "## 1. Opening and Structuring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For attending the set goals, it was decided to proceed with the analysis of two extensively studied **data sets**, that are available on the **Kaggle website**. For an in-depth insight about the both **data sets' attributes**, nominated by the **headers** on the respective **csv files**, check [Google Play Store Apps dataset documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and [Apple Store Apps dataset documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the two considered data sets and posteriorly saving to the same directory as this **jupyter notebook**, both were imported to the present **notebook environment**. As both data sets are in the **csv format**, the usage of the **csv package** built in **Python** can be useful. On this package, exists two widely used methods that structure the input data (that is, organize its content): `Reader` and `DictReader`. For the purpose of a more intuitive data manipulation, as the headers are anticipally known, the subroutine `DictReader` was used, structuring each row of the csv file as an independent dictionary. In order to aggroup the data into one element, the rows on the csv file were condensed as dictionaries on a list, being formally referred as a **list of dictionaries**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulted **data structure** (**list of dictionaries**) allows the data search to be dependent on csv file's headers, as they are the keys of each dictionary on the list. "

These arrays are created by a function - `data_error()` -, which can be tunned for a specific data set by **two input parameters**: `dataset` - list of dictionaries - and `dataset_flag` - string that can have two possible forms, \"google\" or \"apple\". Posteriorly, the said **convertibility to float type test** is seperately performed by other function - `float_type()` -, which takes as input argument the said arrays. Additionally, was imposed a **constraint to the apps' rating attribute**: their maximum range must be 5.0. \n",

As a means of consistently signaling these occurrences on the data set, the respective values were replaced by None (at the cases that previously were empty strings - ''), being this reported on the terminal as **None or empty string**. \n",

    "For the purpose of the statistical analysis to be performed, besides data errors related to data insertion incorrectness on the dataset, the inspection of possible **duplicate entries** of an app in both data sets must be performed. This can be manifested as complete duplicates of an app, with all of their attributes having the exact same values, or with differences in some of those attributes. In this context, the differences may be related with actualizations of data attributes that are mutable with time, like the rating of an app or its downloads, and that were inserted on the data set without previously deleting unactualized data. \n",

For purposes of visualization and better comprehension of algorithm performance, it can be accessed, by switching `all_duplicates` Boolean input parameter - True for accessing and False for not -, the **complete list of duplicates** report (returned as **output** to an array - `duplicate_apps`), which are presented in the form of **tuples (app's name, row on the data set)**. Additionally, if one's would like a more concise visualization, an example of a certain complete group of duplicates can be accessed, by switching `example_duplicates` Boolean input parameter - True for accessing and False for not. This process is tunned for a specific data set by **two input parameters**: `dataset` - list of dictionaries - and `dataset_flag` - string that can have two possible forms, \"google\" or \"apple\". "

    "### Removing Non-English Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating the **primary restraints**, the development of an app directed towards an **English-speaking audience** was highlighted. As a consequence, the statistical analysis must be tuned/finessed for that sub-group of apps encapsulated on a broader group - both data sets of Google Play and App Store. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring both data sets, some apps' names suggest they aren't directed towards an English-speaking audience, spotted by containing some symbols that aren't commonly used in **English text** — English text usually includes letters from the English alphabet, numbers composed of digits from **0 to 9**, punctuation marks **(., !, ?, ;)**, and other symbols **(+, *, /)**. Thus, as previously said, the intention is to remove these apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to conceive the desired algorithm, it's useful to recall how computers process characters. As with everything that is represented and processed by computers, characters are represented by numbers, and, at a more elementary level, on a binary and hexadecimal representation. Different systems of number representation can be reversibly converted into each other, and a more intuitive numeric manipulation for humans is the decimal representation, capturing more concisely the same information as the binary representation. As a standardization, it was conceived the **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) system** for characters representation on computers. In this system, the **numbers corresponding to the characters** we commonly use in an **English text** are all in the range **0 to 127**. Based on this number range, we can build an algorithm that detects whether a character belongs to the set of common English characters or not. If the number is equal to or less than 127, then the character belongs to the set of common English characters. For instance, the corresponding number for the character 'a' is 97, character 'A' is 65, and the character '爱' is 29,233. We can get the **corresponding number of each character** using the `ord()` **built-in function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining with the usage of the `ord()` **built-in function**, the designed algorithm - `inspect_english()` - allows the assessment of each character contained on a given string (app's name to be specified on the `string` **input parameter**), being easily managed since, in Python, strings are indexable and iterable, meaning that is possible to indexing a string in order to select an individual character. As a more automated process, it's equally possible to iterate over a string using a for loop. "

The selected app attribute can be the **genre**, aiming to establish what are the most common genres for each market. Statistically, this can be accomplished by generating **frequency tables**. According to the data sets documentation, the genre of an app is specified by the following keys:\n",
    "- **'prime_genre'** for the Apple Store;\n",
    "- **'Genres'** and **'Category'** for the Google Play Store. An app can belong to multiple genres (apart from its main category), being this captured by the 'Genres' key. The category that each app belongs to is captured by the 'Category' key."

    "\n",
    "The `freq_table` main-function encapsulates the algorithm that generates the frequency table(s) for the said attributes, counting for each distinct genre its total occurrences relative to the entire data set length, assuming the form of a percentage. Given the structure, the frequency table will be organized into a dictionary, with keys relative to the distinct genres or categories and its corresponding values to its percentage on the respective data set, specified on the `dataset` input parameter - list of dictionaries containing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Posteriorly, the reorganization of the frequency table by descending order is tunable by the `descending` **input parameter**, being True its default value, allowing reorganization at descending order. That can be managed by the built-in `sorted()` function, which takes in an iterable data type (like a list, dictionary, tuple, etc.), and returns a list of the elements sorted in ascending or descending order (its `reverse` parameter controls whether the order is ascending or descending). Assuming the parameters of the `sorted()` function as default, the criterion for reorganization considers the dictionary keys, that is, doesn't sort the percentages as desired. For redirecting the **entity to be sorted** - genre's percentages - is necessary to redefine the `key` argument of the `sorted()` function, setting to be an anonymous or **lambda function**. This function only serves to specify a method inside other function, thereby its different designation. In this case, it will tune the `sorted()` function for ordering in respect to the genre's percentages, that are the second element of the **genre-percentage pair** (index 1 in a 0-indexing system - indexing starts at 0). The sorted frequency table is returned as **output** - `sorted_table`."

    "As a measure of **users engagement** towards any group of apps, produced by some categorization (for example, by genre), the number of **installs seems suitable**. As more installs are completed, more users are reachable to ads-exposement, contributing to the augmentation of that genre popularity. \n",

For the Google Play Store data set, this information is encapsulated by the **Installs attribute**, althought being **low precise** due to its representation, with most of the values being open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.). However, very precise data isn't critical for the aimed purposes — the principal aim is to find out which app genres attract the most users, not requering perfect precision with respect to the number of users."

    "From the subgroup of free and English apps on the **Apple Store data set**, by considering the **apps genre popularity**, the **app profile** that emerges as the **better recommendation for development** is one that falls into the **'Navigation' genre**, having aproximatelly **86,000 user ratings on average**. However, by analyzing the **6 most popular Navigation apps**, it's verified that the **average popularity** of this genre is **highly influenced** by the **Waze and Google Maps apps**, which **make together approximatelly half a million user reviews**. This evidence lowers the intrinsic potential engangement that the 'Navigation' genre appeared to initially have. \n",
    "\n",
    "Right after on the popularity average, there is the **Reference apps**, which have aproximatelly **80,000 user ratings on average**. Like previously denoted, it's observed the **pattern of some apps that skew up the average of user ratings**, being this time associated to the **Bible and Dictionary.com**. The same pattern applies to **Social Networking apps**, where the **average number is highly influenced by a few dominate apps, like Facebook, Pinterest, Skype, etc**. Same applies to **Music apps**, where a few big players, like **Pandora, Spotify and Shazam, heavily influence the average number**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this analysis is to find popular genres, but it seems that **navigation, social networking or music apps have initially be considered more popular than they really are**. The average number of ratings seem to be skewed by very few apps which have hundreds of thousands of user ratings, dominating the respective market over the **reminescent apps that are mostly bellow the 10,000 threshold**. Moreover, these niches seem to be **dominated by a few giants who are hard to compete against**. A more in-depth insite about the intrinsic potential engangement of this genres could be captured by **removing those extremely popular apps, for each genre, and posteriorly restimate the averages**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something worth denoting is the fact that the **'Games' genre seems to have a more uniform popularity distribution**, with **less proimence of outliers** on the user ratings' average. However, as previously found by the **Most Common Apps analysis on the Apple data set**, the market subset composed of **apps for entertainment directed seems somehow saturated**, being possibly beneficial to recommend a more distinct app recommendation, if possible. As an alternative, an **investment on the development on a more practical app could be rewarding**. Conciliating with the p**otential of the 'References' genre**, it can be managed the selection of a popular book, making its digitalization and embed with additional features, like daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, dictionary of words within the book, etc. The goal would be to develop an interactive experience related to the book, integrating, as much as possible, features that are treated seperatly by different apps, in order to remove the necessity of exiting the app and acess other external app.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding other genres, the **weather, book, food and drink or finance genres** are also at the **top of the most popular apps by an average of user ratings**. The book genre could be considered as overlapping with the app recommendation described above. The remaining genres don't seem too promising: \n",
    "- **Weather apps** — the users' time exposement is expectably low, reducing the probability of making a profit from in-app adds. Also, getting reliable live weather data may requiring the connection to external non-free of payment entities;\n",
    "- **Food and drink** — the most popular apps (Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's) are mainly related to cooking and delivery services, falling outside the intended app profile;\n",
    "- **Finance apps** — these apps require financial expertise domain, being necessary to include a finance expert in the app development process."

    "This niche seems to be dominated by software for processing and reading ebooks, as well as various collections of libraries and dictionaries, so it's probably not a good idea to build similar apps, since there'll be some significant competition. It was also denoted that there are quite a **few apps built around the book Quran**, which suggests that **building an app that focuses on a popular book can be profitable**. It seems that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. However, it looks like the **market is already full of libraries**, so we **need to add some special features** besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc."
