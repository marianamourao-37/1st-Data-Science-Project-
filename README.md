# Data-Science-Portfolio

Recently, I've developed a great interest in Data Science, mostly ambitioning integrating projects directed to Health, having myself a Bachelor's degree in 
Biomedical Engineering. 

In order to gain experience with Data Science Tools and Methodologies, I'm expousing myself to online courses and guided projects. 
In the phase in which I am, I privilege learning through guided projects that value full participation in each stage of the project, giving an 
opportunity to explore critical and creative thinking. In this sense, the [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/) platform was a major driver in the beginning of this 
journey. 

At the moment, I just completed a project entirely developed by me - [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb) -, 
having been guided by the DataQuest platform. 

As more projects will be developed, they'll be added to this repository.

# Projects

1. [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/marianamourao-37/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb)

In this project, an **introductory data analysis** is made towards a better understanding of **Android** and **iOS mobile apps** on the **Google Play** and the **App 
Store markets**, respectively, aiming to identify **tendencies** and **correlations** between app's attributes and their **profitability**. By doing that, the extracted 
knowledge may be useful to consolidate a strategic approach, taken by a company, for **developing an app** with certain attributes, that lead to an higher expected 
profitability on the two considered markets.
